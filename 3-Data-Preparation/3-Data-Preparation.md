### Questions and Answers

1. **What is the primary purpose of data preparation in ML?**  
   _Answer:_ Data preparation transforms datasets for effective model training and testing, ensuring data quality and compatibility with ML algorithms.

2. **Name some common data formatting issues handled during data preparation.**  
   _Answer:_ Standardizing values, filling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting invalid data are typical tasks.

3. **What is categorical encoding and why is it important?**  
   _Answer:_ It converts categorical values into numerical formats, essential for ML algorithms that require numerical inputs.

4. **Explain the difference between nominal and ordinal categorical variables.**  
   _Answer:_ Nominal variables have no inherent order, whereas ordinal variables have a defined sequence.

5. **Why is one-hot encoding preferred over integer encoding for nominal data?**  
   _Answer:_ It prevents ML models from misinterpreting numerical relationships where none exist.

6. **What is the Bag-of-Words technique in text feature engineering?**  
   _Answer:_ It tokenizes text into individual words, creating a statistical representation of the text.

7. **How does TF-IDF work in text processing?**  
   _Answer:_ It assigns weights to words based on their frequency, reducing the importance of common words.

8. **What is the purpose of feature scaling in numerical data preparation?**  
   _Answer:_ To normalize data ranges, preventing skewness in ML model results.

9. **How does AWS Glue assist in data preparation?**  
   _Answer:_ As an ETL tool, it helps transform data for building data warehouses and data lakes.

10. **What role does AWS SageMaker play in data preparation?**  
    _Answer:_ It facilitates ML model development and data transformations using integrated Jupyter notebooks.

11. **How should missing values be handled in a dataset?**  
    _Answer:_ Strategies include imputation using mean, median, or mode, and applying algorithms like K-nearest neighbors.

12. **Why is feature selection important in ML?**  
    _Answer:_ It involves selecting the most relevant features, reducing complexity and enhancing model accuracy.
